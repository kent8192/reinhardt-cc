# Reinhardt Dependency Injection

Guide developers through DI configuration using reinhardt-di, including service registration, scoping, and integration with database and authentication.

## When to Use

- User configures or creates injectable services
- User asks about DI patterns or scoping
- User mentions: "DI", "dependency injection", "inject", "Provider", "scope", "singleton", "request-scoped", "Injectable"

## Workflow

### Adding a New Injectable Service

1. Read `references/di-patterns.md` for injection patterns
2. Determine scope (request-scoped vs singleton)
3. Implement `Injectable` trait or use auto-implementation
4. Use `#[inject]` in handlers to receive the dependency

### Integrating with Database/Auth

1. Read `references/di-with-db.md` for database pool and auth injection
2. Use built-in types: `DatabaseConnection`, `AuthUser<T>`, `Session`
3. These are already injectable — just use `#[inject]` in handlers

## Important Rules

- Types implementing `Default + Clone + Send + Sync + 'static` get auto-injection
- Custom injection logic requires `#[async_trait] impl Injectable` (method is `inject`, not `resolve`)
- Prefer `#[injectable_factory]` for registering dependencies (async, explicit scope, auto-registered)
- `Injected<T>` is the wrapper type (NOT `Inject<T>` — that type does not exist)
- Reinhardt DI checks: override registry → request scope → singleton → auto-injectable
- Circular dependencies are detected at runtime and return `Err(DiError::CircularDependency)` — they do NOT panic
- `#[use_inject]` enables `#[inject]` in general async functions (not just handlers)
- Test overrides use `ctx.dependency(factory_fn).override_with(value)` for `#[injectable]` functions
- `#[injectable]` auto-derives `Clone` on structs — no need to manually add `#[derive(Clone)]`
- `Depends<T>` requires only `T: Send + Sync + 'static` (NOT `T: Clone`); `into_inner()` requires Clone, but `try_unwrap()` does not
- `DependencyRegistry::register()` panics on duplicate `TypeId` — use newtype wrappers for multiple registrations of the same type
- Users CANNOT register injectables for framework-managed types (`reinhardt::*`, `reinhardt_*::*` namespaces) — wrap in newtypes (pseudo orphan rule)
- Run `cargo reinhardt check-di --validate` to verify missing deps, scope violations, circular deps, and orphan rule compliance

## Dynamic References

For the latest DI API:
1. Read `reinhardt/crates/reinhardt-di/src/lib.rs` for types and traits
2. Read `reinhardt/crates/reinhardt-di/macros/src/lib.rs` for macro documentation
3. Grep for `#[inject]` in `reinhardt/tests/` for real usage examples
