# Reinhardt Authorization

Guide developers through authorization setup using reinhardt-auth, including permission classes, guard types, the `guard!` macro, and auth extractors.

## When to Use

- User configures access control or permissions
- User defines permission classes or guards
- User uses `#[permission_required]` attribute
- User works with `Guard<P>`, `AuthInfo`, or `AuthUser<T>`
- User mentions: "permission", "authorization", "guard", "access control", "role", "admin only", "IsAuthenticated", "AllowAny", "RBAC", "object permission", "model permission", "IP whitelist", "rate limit"

## Workflow

### Adding Permission Checks to Views

1. Read `references/guards.md` for Guard types and `guard!` macro
2. Choose permission class from `references/permissions.md`
3. Apply via `Guard<P>` in handler parameters (DI) or `#[permission_required]` attribute
4. Use `guard!` macro for combining permissions (`&`, `|`, `!`)

### Using Auth Extractors

1. Read `references/extractors.md` for `AuthInfo` and `AuthUser<T>`
2. Use `AuthInfo` for lightweight access (reads request extensions, no DB query)
3. Use `AuthUser<T>` for full user model (loads from DB)
4. Both use `#[inject]` — requires `params` feature

### Implementing Custom Permissions

1. Read `references/permissions.md` for the `Permission` trait
2. Implement `async fn has_permission(&self, context: &PermissionContext<'_>) -> bool`
3. Register as injectable if needed

### Object-Level Permissions

1. Read `references/permissions.md` (Object Permissions section)
2. Implement `ObjectPermissionChecker` trait
3. Use `ObjectPermission<T>` wrapper to create `Permission` impl
4. Manage grants via `ObjectPermissionManager`

## Important Rules

- `Guard<P>` is the primary mechanism for DI-based permission checks (returns 403 on failure)
- `Public` guard always succeeds (equivalent to `AllowAny` in guard context)
- `guard!` macro precedence: `!` > `&` > `|` — use parentheses for clarity
- `AuthInfo` is lightweight (no DB query) — use when you only need auth state
- `AuthUser<T>` loads from DB — use when you need user model fields
- `CurrentUser<T>` is **DEPRECATED** — use `AuthUser<T>` instead
- Permission checks run **before** the handler executes
- `#[permission_required]` is for attribute-based access control on views
- For ViewSet per-action permissions, use `get_permissions_for_action()`
