# Reinhardt Feature Development Architecture

Guide developers through implementing a complete feature across all reinhardt layers, from model definition to API endpoints to tests. This is the "glue" skill that ties individual skills together into a coherent workflow.

## When to Use

- User adds a new entity, resource, or feature end-to-end
- User asks about the recommended order of implementation
- User wants a checklist for feature completeness
- User mentions: "new feature", "implement entity", "full-stack", "architecture", "feature workflow", "add model with API", "implementation guide"

## Workflow

### Implementing a New Feature

Follow the 7-layer sequence. Each step references the appropriate skill for detailed guidance.

1. **Define Model** — read `references/layer-sequence.md` § Model Layer
   - Use the modeling skill: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/modeling/references/model-patterns.md`
2. **Define Serializer** — read `references/layer-sequence.md` § Serializer Layer
   - Use the API skill: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/api-development/references/serializer-patterns.md`
3. **Implement Service** — read `references/layer-sequence.md` § Service Layer
   - Use the DI skill: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dependency-injection/references/di-patterns.md`
4. **Create API Routes** — read `references/layer-sequence.md` § API Layer
   - Use the API skill: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/api-development/references/view-patterns.md`
5. **Register Admin** — read `references/layer-sequence.md` § Admin Layer
   - Use the admin skill: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/admin/references/model-admin.md`
6. **Write Tests** — read `references/layer-sequence.md` § Test Layer
   - Use the testing skill: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/testing/references/rstest-patterns.md`
7. **Add Signals** (optional) — read `references/layer-sequence.md` § Signal Layer
   - Use the signals skill: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/signals/references/reliable-pattern.md`

### Verifying Completeness

After implementation, run through `references/completion-checklist.md` to verify all layers are properly implemented.

### Error Mapping Convention

Read `references/error-mapping.md` for the standard mapping from service-layer errors to HTTP responses.

## Important Rules

- Follow the layer sequence — earlier layers are dependencies for later ones
- Every feature MUST have tests at minimum two layers: unit (service) and integration (API)
- Services MUST return domain types, not ORM models directly
- Error types from services are mapped centrally — do not handle HTTP concerns in services
- ALL code comments must be in English
- Use `reinhardt-query` for custom queries, NEVER raw SQL

## Dynamic References

For the latest API:
1. Read `reinhardt/src/lib.rs` for all facade re-exports
2. Read `reinhardt/crates/reinhardt-rest/src/lib.rs` for serializer types
3. Read `reinhardt/crates/reinhardt-views/src/lib.rs` for view types
4. Read `reinhardt/crates/reinhardt-core/src/signals.rs` for signal types
